            <p class="text">
                Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore.
                Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.

            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Motorcycle drag racing is an American event dating from about 1950. This type of racing consists of a series of acceleration, or top speed, contests, each between two racers, on a straight, smooth-surfaced course that is one-quarter mile long.
                Motorcycle ice racing started in Scandinavia in the 1930s and has spread to other temperate climate countries. It is held on ovals on frozen lakes or on ice-covered stadium tracks, and the bikes use spiked (studded) tires.
                Motorcycle hill climbs are uphill road races in which each rider races against the clock, and only one machine is in motion at any time.

                Rafting is a sport in which rafters use an inflatable raft to race with other teams. The team that reaches the destination first wins the race.
                The racing is done on white water or rough water of different degrees.

            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Skydiving, also called parachuting, use of a parachute—for either recreational or competitive purposes—to slow a diver’s descent to the ground after jumping from an airplane or other high place.
                The sport traces its beginnings to the descents made from a hot-air balloon by the French aeronaut André-Jacques Garnerin in 1797, but modern skydiving is usually performed from a propeller-driven airplane.
